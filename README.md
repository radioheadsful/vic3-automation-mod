# Victoria 3 - Radio's Automation, Transportation and Infra Tweaks Mod

## Description

This Victoria 3 mod makes automation & transportation production methods (the green ones) profitable in 1.5 by reducing the amount of goods required by the PMs following the simple logic that **1K Labourers** can be replaced with either one of:

* 5 Transportation
* 1 Coal
* 1 Iron 
* 1 Tools
* 1 Engines
* 0.5 Electricity
* 0.5 Oil

This mod also adds automation to a few buildings which don't have it in vanilla, namely:

* Chemical Plants
* Electrics Industries
* Explosives Factories
* Military Shipyards
* Shipyards
* Synthetics Plants

Then, the mod adds 3 levels of transportation PMs for Wheat, Rye, Rice, Maize and Millet Farms:

* Road Carts (default, no transportation)
* Rail Transport
* Rail Cars

The idea being that one should be able to benefit from excess transportation in states with little to no mines or lumber.

Lastly, the mod changes railways PMs so that the railways always provide full infrastructure, regardless of the level of employment. This means that you no longer have to subsidize Railways in order to maintain the infranstructure in a state, ensuring that maintaining Railways and infra is no longer a financial burden. The amount of transportation that Railways provide will still change, depending on the employment level of the building, so if you want to ensure plenty of transportation you may still need to subsidize them.

## Compatibility

**This mod is compatible with VTM.**

Compatibility with other mods has not been tested - any mods that change PMs for the buildings listed above will not be compatible, other mods should work just fine. If in doubt, load this mod as the last one in the loading order.
